This smart parking project uses Arduino and various sensors to create an automated parking system. The system utilizes IR sensors to detect the presence of cars in parking slots. The project also includes a servo motor to control a gate that opens and closes to allow cars to enter and exit the parking area.

The code begins by including the necessary libraries, such as the Adafruit_LiquidCrystal library for interfacing with the LCD display, the Servo library for controlling the servo motor, and the Wire library for I2C communication.

The setup function initializes the serial communication, sets the pin modes for the IR sensors, attaches the servo motor to the appropriate pin, and initializes the LCD display. It also reads the initial sensor values and calculates the available parking slots.

In the main loop, the sensor values are continuously read and displayed on the LCD. The available slots are updated based on the sensor readings. The code also checks for the presence of cars at the entrance and exit points. If a car is detected at the entrance and there are available slots, the servo motor opens the gate and reduces the available slots count. If a car is detected at the exit and the gate is already open, the servo motor closes the gate and increases the available slots count.

The Read_Sensor function reads the values from the IR sensors and updates the corresponding variables.

This project provides a basic implementation of a smart parking system using Arduino. It can be further enhanced by integrating it with a mobile app or a web interface for remote monitoring and management of parking slots. Additionally, additional features such as vehicle recognition, payment systems, and real-time availability tracking can be incorporated to improve the functionality of the system.

## Additional information

Here is some additional information about the libraries used in the code and some keywords:

1. Adafruit_LiquidCrystal Library:
   - The Adafruit_LiquidCrystal library is used for controlling character LCD displays.
   - It provides an easy-to-use interface for displaying text and controlling the display's cursor and backlight.
   - The library supports both 4-bit and 8-bit data transmission modes and is compatible with a wide range of LCD displays.
   - It simplifies the process of initializing and communicating with the LCD display.

2. Servo Library:
   - The Servo library is used for controlling servo motors.
   - It provides functions to easily set the position of a servo motor, allowing it to rotate to specific angles.
   - The library abstracts the low-level details of generating the necessary PWM signals to control the servo motor's position.
   - It supports controlling multiple servo motors simultaneously.

3. Wire Library:
   - The Wire library is used for I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) communication.
   - I2C is a two-wire serial communication protocol used for communication between microcontrollers and peripheral devices.
   - The Wire library provides functions for sending and receiving data over the I2C bus.
   - It simplifies the process of interfacing with I2C devices, such as I2C LCD displays or sensors.

Keywords used in the code:

1. `pinMode()`:
   - `pinMode()` is a function used to configure a specific pin of the Arduino board as either input or output.
   - It takes two arguments: the pin number and the mode (INPUT or OUTPUT).
   - In the code, `pinMode()` is used to set the appropriate pins for the IR sensors and other components.

2. `digitalRead()`:
   - `digitalRead()` is a function used to read the digital state (HIGH or LOW) of a specific pin.
   - It takes one argument: the pin number from which to read the state.
   - In the code, `digitalRead()` is used to read the states of the IR sensors and determine the presence of cars.

3. `attach()`:
   - `attach()` is a function used to attach a servo motor to a specific pin on the Arduino board.
   - It takes one argument: the pin number to which the servo motor is connected.
   - In the code, `attach()` is used to attach the servo motor to pin 9.

4. `write()`:
   - `write()` is a function used to set the position of a servo motor.
   - It takes one argument: the desired position, specified in degrees.
   - In the code, `write()` is used to control the opening and closing of the gate by setting the servo motor's position.

These libraries and keywords simplify the implementation of the smart parking system by providing pre-defined functions and functionality, allowing for easier control of the LCD display, servo motor, and I2C communication.
